# zhihu-in-terminal
## Intro
I was inspired by [duduainankai/zhihu-terminal](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=zhihu+terminal)  
but I decide to simplify it and add some additional functions.  
zhihu-in-terminal will be maintain at a very long time because it's so fun and useful.
## Functions
- be able to see the questions and their answers according to your key world
- store the content and read it even there are no network connections
- machine learning and differ from zhihu
- step by step
